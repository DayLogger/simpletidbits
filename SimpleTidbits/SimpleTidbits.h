/*
 The goal of the SimpleTidbits Framework is to be a collection of little
 useful bits of code.
 
 It contains quite a few categories with useful methods in them and a few
 not so little, but very helpful classes.
 
 Classes:
 
 STNetworkIndicator		- lets you nest calls to show the network indicator as well
	as having different places in your app that show different network
	indicator loading statuses.
 
 STSimpleURLConnection	- just a simpler version of NSURLConnection.
 
 STFileCache	- A utility for downloading and caching files. Simply give it a
	url and it will return the file and cache it for any later requests.
 
 STImageView	- An image view that you can simply give a url to and it will
	load up the image using STFileCache.
