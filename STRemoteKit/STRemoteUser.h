 STRemoteUser
 ------------
 
 STRemoteUser is available for the following reasons:
 
 * Allows you to find out if the user is logged in.
 * Allows you to ask the user to login (or signup).
 * Allows STRemoteData to log the user out on an unauthorized error.
 
 STRemoteUser sends out a logged in notification on actual login OR when the
 shared instance is created and the user is already logged in.
 
 STRemoteUser sends out a logged out notification on `logout`.
 
 Subclassing
 -----------
 
 STRemoteUser __requires__ that you subclass in order to show the correct
 login as well as authenticate STRemoteData's requests.
 
 STRemoteUser is a singleton, so make sure you call your class first to make
 the singleton an instance of your class.
